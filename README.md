# ToDo app 

## To practice JavaScript I have made a ToDo list app

The Todo app can add and remove and check tasks as done. Further more you can add Date and Time to the tasks.

You can remove single tasks one at a time or remove all done tasks at once with the push of a button.

The App is repsonsive.

It has been built with HTML, CSS & Vanilla JavaScript
